# Planetary Periods (Dasha)

## Introduction
Dasha, or planetary periods, represents one of the most powerful predictive tools in Vedic astrology. This system provides a structured framework for timing events and understanding the varying planetary influences throughout an individual's life. The most widely used system is the Vimshottari Dasha, which operates on a 120-year cycle.

## The Vimshottari Dasha System
The Vimshottari Dasha system divides time into major periods (Mahadashas) ruled by nine planets, each with its specific duration:

- Ketu: 7 years
- Venus: 20 years
- Sun: 6 years
- Moon: 10 years
- Mars: 7 years
- Rahu: 18 years
- Jupiter: 16 years
- Saturn: 19 years
- Mercury: 17 years

### Starting Point Determination
The starting point of an individual's Dasha cycle is determined by:
1. The position of the Moon in a particular Nakshatra (lunar mansion) at birth
2. The specific portion of the Nakshatra where the Moon is positioned
3. The ruling planet of that portion, which becomes the starting Mahadasha lord

## Levels of Dasha Periods

### 1. Mahadasha (Major Period)
- The primary planetary period
- Lasts for the full duration assigned to the ruling planet
- Sets the overall tone for that time period

### 2. Antardasha (Sub-Period)
- Operates within each Mahadasha
- Follows the same sequence of planets
- Provides more specific timing of events

### 3. Pratyantar Dasha (Sub-Sub Period)
- Further divisions of Antardashas
- Offers precise timing for specific events
- Helps in fine-tuning predictions

## Interpretation Principles

### Basic Considerations
1. Nature and significations of the Dasha lord
2. Placement of the Dasha lord in the birth chart
3. Aspects received by the Dasha lord
4. Houses ruled by the Dasha lord
5. Relationship with other planets
