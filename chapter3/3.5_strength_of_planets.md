# 3.5 Strength of Planets (Shadbala)

Shadbala, meaning "six strengths" in Sanskrit, is a comprehensive system in Vedic astrology for assessing the overall strength and influence of planets in a birth chart. This system provides a nuanced understanding of how planetary positions manifest in various aspects of life. The six components of Shadbala are:

## 1. Sthana Bala (Positional Strength)

Sthana Bala measures the strength a planet gains from its position in the zodiac. It consists of five sub-components:

a) Uccha Bala: Strength based on the planet's proximity to its exaltation point.
b) Saptavargaja Bala: Strength derived from the planet's position in seven divisional charts.
c) Ojayugmarasyamsa Bala: Strength based on placement in odd/even signs and navamsa.
d) Kendradi Bala: Strength from placement in angular, succedent, or cadent houses.
e) Drekkana Bala: Strength based on the planet's position in decanates.

**Example**: If Jupiter is at 5° Cancer (close to its exaltation at 5° Cancer), it will have high Uccha Bala, contributing significantly to its Sthana Bala.

**Calculation**: Sthana Bala = Uccha Bala + Saptavargaja Bala + Ojayugmarasyamsa Bala + Kendradi Bala + Drekkana Bala

## 2. Dig Bala (Directional Strength)

Dig Bala assesses a planet's strength based on its placement in specific houses of the chart. Each planet has a preferred house where it gains maximum Dig Bala:

- Sun and Mars: 10th house
- Jupiter and Mercury: 1st house
- Moon and Venus: 4th house
- Saturn: 7th house

**Example**: Venus in the 4th house would have full Dig Bala, enhancing its ability to influence matters related to home, emotions, and domestic happiness.

**Calculation**: Dig Bala is calculated based on the planet's distance from its ideal house, with a maximum of 60 virupas (units) when in the perfect position.

## 3. Kala Bala (Temporal Strength)

Kala Bala measures a planet's strength based on various time factors:

a) Nathonnatha Bala: Strength during day or night
b) Paksha Bala: Strength during waxing or waning lunar phase
c) Tribhaga Bala: Strength in different parts of the day or night
d) Abda Bala: Annual strength
e) Masa Bala: Monthly strength
f) Vara Bala: Weekday strength
g) Hora Bala: Hourly strength
h) Ayana Bala: Strength based on the Sun's declination

**Example**: The Sun gains strength during the day and in the bright half of the lunar month.

**Calculation**: Kala Bala = Sum of all temporal strength components

## 4. Chesta Bala (Motional Strength)

Chesta Bala refers to the strength a planet gains from its motion - whether it's direct, retrograde, or stationary. This applies to all planets except the Sun and Moon.

**Example**: Mars in retrograde motion gains higher Chesta Bala, potentially intensifying its effects in the natal chart.

**Calculation**: Chesta Bala is determined by the planet's speed and direction of motion, with retrograde motion generally conferring higher strength.

## 5. Naisargika Bala (Natural Strength)

Naisargika Bala is the innate strength of a planet, regardless of its position. This strength is fixed for each planet:

- Sun: 60 virupas
- Moon: 51.43 virupas
- Mars: 42.86 virupas
- Mercury: 34.29 virupas
- Jupiter: 25.71 virupas
- Venus: 17.14 virupas
- Saturn: 8.57 virupas

**Example**: The Sun, with the highest Naisargika Bala, naturally exerts a strong influence in any chart.

## 6. Drik Bala (Aspectual Strength)

Drik Bala measures the strength a planet gains or loses due to aspects from other planets. Benefic aspects increase strength, while malefic aspects decrease it.

**Example**: Jupiter aspecting Mercury would increase Mercury's Drik Bala, potentially enhancing its positive significations in the chart.

**Calculation**: Drik Bala = Strength gained from benefic aspects - Strength lost from malefic aspects

## Total Shadbala Calculation

To calculate the total Shadbala of a planet, astrologers sum up all six components:

Total Shadbala = Sthana Bala + Dig Bala + Kala Bala + Chesta Bala + Naisargika Bala + Drik Bala

The result is typically expressed in virupas or rupas (1 rupa = 60 virupas). Each planet has a minimum required strength to be considered capable of producing its effects:

- Sun: 390 virupas
- Moon: 360 virupas
- Mars: 300 virupas
- Mercury: 420 virupas
- Jupiter: 390 virupas
- Venus: 330 virupas
- Saturn: 300 virupas

Planets exceeding these values are considered strong and capable of producing their full significations.

In practice, astrologers use Shadbala to assess a planet's capacity to influence various life areas. For instance, a strong Jupiter with high Shadbala might indicate excellent opportunities for higher education, spiritual growth, and financial prosperity. Conversely, a weak Saturn might suggest challenges in career and responsibilities.

Understanding Shadbala allows astrologers to provide more accurate and nuanced interpretations of planetary influences, helping individuals navigate life's challenges and opportunities with greater awareness and preparation.
