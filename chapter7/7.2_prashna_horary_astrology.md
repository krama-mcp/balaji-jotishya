# 7.2 Prashna (Horary Astrology)

Prashna, also known as Horary Astrology, is a branch of Vedic astrology that provides insights and predictions based on the precise moment a question is asked. Unlike natal astrology which uses a birth chart, Prashna focuses solely on the energies present at the time of inquiry.

## Basic Principles of Prashna

1. Timing: The exact time, date, and location when a question is asked are used to cast the Prashna chart. This moment is considered to hold the answer to the query.

2. Ascendant and Houses: The rising sign (Lagna) at the time of the question is crucial. Each house in the chart represents different aspects of life relevant to the query.

3. Significators: Specific planets or points in the chart represent the querent (person asking) and quesited (thing asked about).

4. Moon's Role: The Moon is given special importance as it represents the mind and emotions of the querent.

5. Planetary Dignity: The strength and condition of planets in the chart are vital for interpretation.

## Analysis Methods

1. House Analysis: Determine which house relates to the question and analyze its ruler and occupants.

2. Planetary Aspects: Examine aspects between significator planets and other relevant planets.

3. Strength of Significators: Assess the essential and accidental dignity of key planets.

4. Reception: Analyze how planets "receive" each other based on their zodiacal placements.

5. Lunar Phases and Motion: The phase and speed of the Moon can indicate timing and potential outcomes.

## Special Techniques

1. Tajik Yogas: These are special planetary combinations used in Prashna, including:
   - Ithashala Yoga: Indicates favorable outcomes
   - Isharaf Yoga: Suggests unfavorable results
   - Kambool Yoga: A powerful combination involving the Moon

2. Navamsha Analysis: The Navamsha (9th harmonic) chart is used to verify and refine predictions.

3. Radicality: Some astrologers check for chart "radicality" to ensure the question is genuine and timely.

4. Timing Methods: Various techniques are used to time events, including planetary periods (dashas) and time-based analysis of aspects.

## Practical Example

Let's consider a Prashna about a potential job offer:

1. Ascendant Analysis: If the Ascendant is in a fixed sign like Taurus, it suggests stability in the current situation.

2. 10th House (Career): Examine its ruler and occupants. For example, if Jupiter is strong in the 10th, it indicates positive career prospects.

3. Significators: The querent might be represented by the Ascendant ruler, while the potential job could be signified by the 10th lord.

4. Moon's Position: If the Moon is applying to a favorable aspect with the 10th lord, it suggests the job offer is likely to materialize.

5. Tajik Yogas: An Ithashala Yoga between the Ascendant lord and 10th lord would be a strong indicator of securing the job.

## Traditional References

The principles of Prashna are rooted in ancient texts:

- Prashna Marga: A comprehensive 16th-century work on Horary astrology.
- Brihat Samhita: Varahamihira's work includes sections on Prashna techniques.
- Krishneeyam: Another classical text focusing on Prashna methods.

These texts emphasize the importance of the astrologer's intuition and spiritual connection in accurately interpreting Prashna charts.
