# 7.3 Compatibility Analysis (Gun Milan)

Compatibility Analysis (Gun Milan) is a traditional Vedic astrological method used to assess the compatibility between potential marriage partners. The primary system used for this analysis is called Ashtakoot, which evaluates eight key aspects of compatibility.

## Ashtakoot System

The Ashtakoot system analyzes the following eight factors, with a total possible score of 36 points:

1. Varna (1 point): Represents spiritual compatibility and ego levels.

2. Vashya (2 points): Measures mutual attraction and influence between partners.

3. Tara (3 points): Indicates overall well-being and longevity of the relationship.

4. Yoni (4 points): Assesses sexual compatibility and intimacy.

5. Graha Maitri (5 points): Evaluates mental compatibility and friendship.

6. Gana (6 points): Examines temperament and behavior compatibility.

7. Bhakoot (7 points): Analyzes emotional compatibility and mutual understanding.

8. Nadi (8 points): Considers health compatibility and potential issues with progeny.

## Scoring and Interpretation

The total score from these eight factors determines the overall compatibility:

- 0-17 points: Not recommended for marriage
- 18-24 points: Average match, acceptable
- 25-32 points: Very good match
- 33-36 points: Excellent match

For example, if a couple scores 28 points in their Ashtakoot analysis, it would be considered a very good match with a high likelihood of a successful marriage.

## Additional Factors

While Ashtakoot is the primary system, astrologers often consider additional factors for a more comprehensive analysis:

1. Mangal Dosha: Checks for the negative influence of Mars in the horoscopes.

2. Navamsa Chart: Analyzes the ninth divisional chart for deeper insights.

3. Dashakoota: A more detailed system used in South India that considers ten factors instead of eight.

4. Planetary positions and aspects: Examines the overall planetary influences on the relationship.

## Special Considerations

1. Nadi Dosha: If both partners have the same Nadi (out of Vata, Pitta, and Kapha), it's considered unfavorable. However, this can be offset by other positive factors.

2. Mahendra and Vedha points: Some astrologers include these additional points for a more nuanced analysis.

3. Regional variations: The interpretation and importance given to various factors may differ between North and South Indian astrological traditions.

## Practical Example

Let's consider a hypothetical couple:

- Varna: 1/1
- Vashya: 2/2
- Tara: 2/3
- Yoni: 3/4
- Graha Maitri: 4/5
- Gana: 5/6
- Bhakoot: 6/7
- Nadi: 8/8

Total: 31/36

This couple would be considered a very good match, with strong compatibility in most areas. The lower score in Tara might indicate a need for extra care in matters of overall well-being, but the perfect scores in Nadi and Varna suggest strong spiritual and health compatibility.

## Traditional References

The concept of Gun Milan is rooted in ancient Vedic texts. The Brihat Parasara Hora Shastra, a foundational text of Vedic astrology, mentions the importance of horoscope matching. The specific system of Ashtakoot is believed to have been developed and refined over centuries by various astrologers and scholars.

In conclusion, while Gun Milan provides valuable insights into potential compatibility, it's important to remember that a successful marriage also depends on mutual understanding, respect, and effort from both partners. Modern astrologers often advise couples to use these traditional methods as a guide rather than an absolute determinant of marital success.
