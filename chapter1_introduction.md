Vedic astrology, also known as Jyotish or Hindu astrology, is an ancient Indian system of astrology that traces its roots back to the Vedic period, over 5,000 years ago. This sacred science is considered one of the six auxiliary disciplines (Vedangas) of the Vedas, specifically connected to the eye of the Vedas, as it helps in seeing and understanding time, karma, and cosmic influences.

### Key Historical Points:
